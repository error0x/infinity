  //ELEMENT FOUR: TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS
obstacles_13_1
  On a short timescale
  Considered an unreachable destination (requires wormhole technology or is beyond current human influence)
  Numerous distractions along the way (side missions, rival factions, opportunities)
  Key knowledge is required (held in a location or by a person— usually guarded)
  Physically or environmentally challenging (zero-g, rad zone, desert, corrupt location, acid rain)
  Another corporate power or faction is also   involved (GM’s choice of Table 2, 3, or 4 to  determine) //TODO
  It is guarded by a Nemesis or Elite adversary
  They must carry a hindrance: {fragile asset | incompetent person | dangerous prisoner}
  Battered by the elements: {volcanic activity | sand |snow storms |earthquakes |tsunamis}
  Must enter a contested warzone
  An O-12 faction interferes “for the good of humanity” : [scenario_hooks_7_1] - [scenario_draws_7_2]
  Defective assets: {rotten| stolen| corrupted| faulty}
  Extortionate cost (in something the characters value)
  Lesser of two evils (working with an   uncomfortable ally)
  Civil unrest (riots, terrorists)
  Extortion and bribery (a group member is bribed or held to ransom)
  Sold misinformation
  Problems with the authorities (arrest, detention, passport control)
  Strange malady that requires the antagonists plot fulfilment to cur
  Ambushed!

plottwists_13_2
  They must make a great personal sacrifice (one or more group members)
  They are the experiment (a group or faction is testing their abilities)
  Led into a trap (they are the antagonists missing ingredient)
  Into the jaws of death (nobody is expected to leave alive)
  The antagonist is part of the group (if played right,maybe even a character)
  Intelligence leads them to believe there is only one to contend with (they were wrong!)
  Familial connections (antagonist has family ties to, or is known well by a character)
  Snake in the grass (a traitor working for an independent faction: [mercenary_faction_4])
  High body count (the Pyrrhic victory)
  Damned if we do… (letting the antagonist escape will save countless lives)
  A person or asset that is a requirement of the mission is also exactly what the antagonist needs
  To understand villainy, you must become the villain (they must do bad things to achieve their goal)
  The antagonist is a patsy for the true antagonist: [antagonist_1_1] who is [antagonist_1_2]
  The antagonist is committing terrible crimes in the hope of preventing a greater evil
  Fulfilment before their eyes (the group arrives too late or the event unfolds around them)
  Cut off and left adrift (the group’s employer falls strangely silent and no longer provides support)
  A key character of the plot is killed, only to return alive later (can be keyed to Twist They're the experiment or Traitor in their own faction)
  The characters are working for the real villain, their antagonist is trying to stop them
  Misdirection (the plot is a complete cover for the real scheme—roll again for the second layer)
  Escalation: [plottwists_13_2] and [plottwists_13_2]
