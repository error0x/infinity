//  - You can change the URL of your generator by clicking the "settings" button in the top-right
//  - Use this template if you want your generator to be vertically centered on the page:  perchance.org/centered-minimal#edit
//  - Add background images, fonts, and other stuff with plugins: perchance.org/plugins
//  - Here are some templates that you can use to create nice-looking generators without learning HTML and CSS:  perchance.org/templates
