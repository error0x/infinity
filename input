//  - Highlight multiple lines and press Tab or Shift+Tab to indent and un-indent them all an once
//  - You can change the URL of your generator by clicking the "settings" button in the top-right
//  - Use this template if you want your generator to be vertically centered on the page:  perchance.org/centered-minimal#edit
//  - Add background images, fonts, and other stuff with plugins: perchance.org/plugins
//  - Here are some templates that you can use to create nice-looking generators without learning HTML and CSS:  perchance.org/templates
//  - Use the "layout maker" plugin to create complex layouts without learning how to code:  perchance.org/layout-maker-plugin
//  - Here are some generators you might like to import:  perchance.org/useful-generators
//  - Read this page after reading the tutorial:  perchance.org/examples
//  - There's a "wrap" button in the top-right if your lines are really long. If you add   $output=[this.joinItems(" ")]   as the first item in your list, then writing [yourListName] will magically output all of the items joined together, rather than a random item from the "yourListName" list.
